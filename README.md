# How to use

1. Create a webhook in your discord server (I recommend to do this on a private server)
2. Install all of the required modules by running `install.bat`
3. Create the config by running `config.bat` and filling out the required fields
4. There you go! Now you can choose to obfuscate this code or implement it as a backdoor in a different program (For example: an electron application)
5. Enjoy!
